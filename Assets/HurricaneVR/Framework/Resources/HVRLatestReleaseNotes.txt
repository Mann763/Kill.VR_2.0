2.8.4

Fixed an issue with the version update check logic that was refreshing the asset database after compiles.

Distance Grab Updates:
	Force Pull logic re-worked using kinematics that takes into account mass, gravity, and hand velocity.
	Force Pull Settings updated with Max Acceleration Force, Max Speed, Damping speed parameters to control behaviour.
	
Hand Grab "Pull" sequence is improved and should be smoother, especially after a distance grab is executed.

HVRGrabbable : Added 'BreakDistanceSource' [NoDistanceCheck, Hand, Controller] to control the distance check against the object, or to prevent dropping from distance altogether.

2.8.3.1

OpenXR - added package check and update helper if 1.3 and higher version isn't detected.
VRIK Setup - fix IK solve at setup end when avatar spine isn't using normal forward / right vectors.
Adjust force grab default max force (was too strong for hexabody)


2.8.3

Fixed GC alloc in the socket detection
HVRControllerOffset will smoothly move / rotate to the grab points offset value instead of immediately snapping.
Tweaked force grabber to bring the object closer to the hand before the hand takes over.
Updated Hand Setup Wizard instructions to be more clear.

2.8.2

HurricaneVR extra dll's have been collapsed into a single final dll 'HurricaneVR.Framework'

Fix HVRStabber when the tip / base transforms aren't directly a child of the stabber
Fix HVRTeleporter capsule overlap check math that was failing at small capsule sizes.
Fix grabbing when the hand was set to toggle grab mode but the grabbable was set to Active mode.
Improved post teleport hand / held object positioning if the user rotated the player to a new direction.
HVRSocket - scale grabbable defaulted to false
Added basic EmeraldAI (v3) integration scene
HVRSettings - new DisableHaptics toggle 
HVRPhysicsDial - fixed anchor to start at 0,0,0


2.8

Fixed socket container grabber (example scene chest uses this)
Fixed impact component when rigidbody is missing 
Fixed socket hover scale not completely hitting it's target scale size.
Fixed post teleport grabbable dropping due to the break distance check triggering
Fixed hand rotation post manual teleport
Fixed hand animator bug where finger curls were not properly applied to secondary poses.
Fixed hand animator to respect individual blend pose speeds.
Fixed gravity gloves adding Y force after a auto catch.
Fixed bug in custom hand setup wizard if hand didn't have tip transforms already.
Greatly improved post teleport collision handling
Improved post collision sweep after hand max distance reached
HandPoser blends with Speed of 0 will immediately lerp and not use smoothing to the target pose.
Demo SMG and Pistol trigger poses updated with speed of 0.
Suggested default MaxAngularSpeed reduced to 30.
HVRStabber Optimized GC allocation by caching stabbable colliders on start for reuse

HVRHandGrabber
	Pusher [Box Collider] & PushoutTime [float] : optional box collider (generated automatically if not supplied) that will grow from zero to max size over PushoutTime.
		Used when Hand goes to retrieve an object to ensure the hand doesn't get stuck in collision geometry.
		Used after overlap clearance with a dropped object times out and is still overlapping to push the stuck object out of the hand.
		Used after release if collisions were disabled on the hand while holding an object.
		Users can start the push sequence by calling StartPushing if desired.
	Pull Sequence Changes:
		If pulling a grabbed object to the hand times out while trying to orient to the pose position, the hand will go retrieve
		the object if the remaining angle difference is greater than "Move Threshold". This should help prevent objects getting stuck
		when the fixed joint is created with the hand.
		

HVRGrabbable:
	OverrideMaxDistanceBehaviour & MaxDistanceBehaviour to override what happens after the hand gets to far from the controller.
	LinkedGrabbables: additional grabbables that might be on the same rigidbody to consider it a two hand grab.
	InstantHandPose: If true, the removed object will instantly be orienated based on it's pose. Large sockets in demo scene enabled.
	GrabBehaviour: override the Hand's "Pull or Hand Grab's" behaviour. (Default, PullToHand, HandRetrieves)
	FinalJointMaxAngle defaulted to 15.
	FinalJointTimeout defaulted to .25 seconds.

HVRSocket
	DisableCollision: If false socketed objects maintain their collision, used only for static or kinematic rb sockets.
	InstantHandPose: If true, the removed object will instantly be orienated based on it's pose. Large sockets in demo scene enabled.
