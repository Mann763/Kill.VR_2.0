Using effects:
Just drag and drop prefab of effect on scene and use that :)

Using shaders:
Slash shader works only with particle system using "Custom vertex stream.xy". Use custom data x and y. One for slash range, another for slash distance.
Tornado shader works only with particle system using "Custom vertex stream.xy". Use custom data x. This value is responsible for dissolving the effect.
