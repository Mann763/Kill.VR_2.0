Version 1.41

Fixed MoveToPosition not working correctly
Added Reset player position example for falling through the world with HexaResetZone

Version 1.4

Physics hands updated with experimental (and optional) hand stuck detection. 
Reworked the logic that checks if additional air crouching is allowed.
Fixed an issue with grounded angle check that feeds in the slope angle friction curve.
Pelvis collider will now try to remain above the locoball collider to prevent getting stuck.

HurricaneVR users will need to update to 2.5.1 and re-extract the integration there.



Version 1.3.3

Completely re-worked the V4 jump system, tests show it's near accurate to hitting the desired jump height
that is defined in the crouch -> height JumpHeight curve.
Fixed hand physics tracking when the player is moving in real life.
Improved hand physics tracking when smooth and snap turning.


Version 1.3.2

HexaV4:
	Tweaked behaviour to auto stand speed when walking / running and not actively crouching. Auto stand will now occur
	based on the amount of input movement detected.
	Crouch limits renamed to "RunningCrouchLevel" and "WalkingCrouchLevel" and changed to be % of leg.
	Added GroundedRadius field to control the sphere cast size that detects whether the player is grounded or not.
		The default size is reduced to .05f from the full size of the ball to detect only grounded when the bottom of the ball
		is close to the surface. This will help with the new Air Max Crouch lift that is only available when not grounded.

	
Version 1.3.1

Fixed an issue where calibrating without the HMD on would lead to a divide by 0 error.
Added additional checks to determine when the ungrounded max crouch level is allowed.

Version 1.3

V4 Iteration of the HexaBody is now complete. Featuring improvements to locomotion, standing, crouching, and jumping.

Some notable improvements with the new player:
	-Increased anti roll resistance, helping unwanted movement especially on slopes.
	-Reworked jump height system using kinematics to solve crouch -> jump height
	-Optional jump horizontal velocity bonus based on crouch amount.
	-Slope angle friction curves applied to the locomotion ball.
	-HMD Detection to keep the player in it's placed position.
	-Retract / Stomp curves to control ball lift during the jump cycle.
	-Customizable crouch offset levels
	-Smooth acceleration with direction acceleration curves to control changing of direction responsiveness.
	-Vaulting is now easier with customizable max crouch height while not grounded (lift the ball even higher).
	-Fine control of movement / crouching / standing based on amount the joystick is moved.
	-Optional height calibration saving to player prefs to assist in debugging cycles.

Version 1.24
Added SlipperMaterial field and EnableSlippery() / DisableSlipperyMethods()
When enabled the slippery material will be applied to the locoball, and reset to previous values when disabled.

Version 1.23
Flattened Camera X rotation before rotating torso in FaceDirection method
Capped locoball angular velocity when not grounded

Version 1.22

Added CalibrateHeightOnStart option and set to default to false. 


Version 1.21
Fixes:
The FenderSphere mesh object used for visualizing the body had it's sphere collider left on by accident. The player v3 prefab
has been updated with it removed, if you unpacked your prefab make sure to remove it as it would affect friction when up against something.

Version 1.2

Fixes:
Changed the steamvr bindings manifest key to prevent conflicts with the one from hurricanevr

Added MoveToPosition which takes the position that the bottom of the locosphere will land and moves all of the 
	necessary rigidbodies maintaining their offset from the locoball
	
Added FaceDirection which takes a vector and rotates the torso so that the camera faces this direction

HexaBodyPlayer3:
Add LeftShoulder and RightShoulder transform fields
Add LeftHandRigidbody and RightHandRigidbody fields
Added DefaultArmLength field and SetArmLength method that will create joint limits from the shoulder to the hand
MaxDistance on HexaHands should be updated when calibrating arm length on the hexabody
v3 prefabs updated with new required fields

HexaHands:
Add Shoulder transform, if provided will be the anchor for limiting the hand distance by "MaxDistance"

Added steamvr readme for setup


Version 1.1

Added SteamVR bindings integration package and updated the input collector to use SteamVR Inputs 
Install SteamVR from the asset store, unload the package, and Save And Generate the action classes when prompted
Add HEXA_STEAMVR scripting define symbol to make use of the bindings
